# image-processing
Hello this project is about IMAGE PROCESSING functions and we learn: -> Configure and run an opencv project in visual studio -> Read and show images -> Rotate the image

REQUIREMENTS:- -> Opencv , Visual Studio

PREREQUITIES:- Opencv and visual studio installed locally , Depending upon OS

HOW TO RUN:- 
1-> Starting with some basic image processing operations using opencv libraries in c++ programming language. 1-> must include opencv libraries in the first line of code: #include<opencv2/opencv.hpp>

2-> READ AND SHOW IMAGE for this we use iostream libraries and we should include it to code ex- #include<opencv2/opencv.hpp> #include using namespace std; using namespace cv; void main() {..  }

Hence, in this way project for image processing is made using opencv.
